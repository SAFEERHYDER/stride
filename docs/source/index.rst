Stride
======

`Stride <https://www.stride.codes>`_ is an open-source library for ultrasound modelling and tomography that provides flexibility and scalability
together with production-grade performance.

It lets users easily prototype medical imaging algorithms with only a few lines of Python code that
can run seamlessly on a local workstation, a multi-node CPU cluster or a DGX station with production-grade performance.

Stride provides end-to-end definition of the imaging process using state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms,
and the flexibility to (re)define every step of the optimisation.
