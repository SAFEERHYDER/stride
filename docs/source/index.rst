Stride
======

`Stride <https://github.com/trustimaging/stride>`_ is an open-source library for medical ultrasound modelling and tomography.
It lets users easily prototype medical imaging algorithms with only a few lines of Python code that
can run seamlessly on a Jupyter notebook, a multi-node CPU cluster or a DGX station with production-grade performance.
Stride provides end-to-end definition of the imaging process using state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms,
and the flexibility to (re)define every step of the optimisation.
